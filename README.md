### Best Chocolate Project
This repo is a data science project to determine which cacao bar is the best tasting worldwide.

### Installation
No installation is required.  The jupyter notebook is self-explanatory.

### Project Motivation
I am interested in determining which chocolate is the best in the world, and where the beans are sourced.  The following questions in this Python3 Jupyter Notebook are answered:

Where are the best beans sourced?

What is the absolute highest expert rated chocolate?

Is there a relationship between cacao percentage in a chocolate bar and its ratings?

### File Description
This Jupyter Notebook is exploratory in searching through the above questions and more.

### Results
The main findings of the code is available in the Medium post [UNDER CONSTRUCTION.](https://medium.com/@sjwilli7/this-will-make-you-rethink-comfort-food-the-best-chocolate-in-the-world-9988e5f83186)
